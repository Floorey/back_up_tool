# Rust Backup Tool

## Overview
This is a command-line backup tool for Linux systems written in Rust, designed to simplify the process of creating and managing backups. With this tool, users can easily schedule backups, specify directories to backup, and define backup destinations.

## Features
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple configuration file for specifying backup settings.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for scheduling backups at specific intervals or times.
- **Selective Backup**: Ability to specify directories or files for backup.
- **Multiple Destinations**: Option to backup to local or remote destinations such as external drives or cloud storage.
- **Incremental Backups**: Support for incremental backups to save time and storage space.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging to track backup operations and any errors.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-backup-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-backup-tool
   ```

3. Build the backup tool:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Run the backup tool:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/backup
   ```

## Configuration
The backup tool can be configured via the `config.toml` file. Here's an example configuration:
```toml
[backup]
source_dir = "/path/to/source/directory"
destination_dir = "/path/to/backup/destination"
schedule = "daily"
```

## Usage
1. Edit the `config.toml` file to specify the source directory, destination directory, and backup schedule.
2. Build the backup tool using Cargo.
3. Run the generated executable to start the backup process.
